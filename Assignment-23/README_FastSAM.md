# [1. Document Edge Detection using FastSAM](https://huggingface.co/spaces/rahulch1502/FastSam-Document-Cropping) ðŸ”—

The Fast Segment Anything Model(FastSAM) is a CNN Segment Anything Model trained using only 2% of the SA-1B dataset published by SAM authors. FastSAM achieves comparable performance with the SAM method at 50Ã— higher run-time speed.

### Model Checkpoints

Two model versions of the model are available with different sizes. Click the links below to download the checkpoint for the corresponding model type.

### FastSAM for Document Edge Detection:

As seen in above image, without any custom training FastSAM is able to identify the document while ignoring the background. Hence this model can be used for cropping and removing background from images.
